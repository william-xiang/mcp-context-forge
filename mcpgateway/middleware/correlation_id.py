Correlation ID (Request ID) Middleware.

This middleware handles X-Correlation-ID HTTP headers and maps them to the internal
request_id used throughout the system for unified request tracing.

Key concept: HTTP X-Correlation-ID header → Internal request_id field (single ID for entire request flow)

The middleware automatically extracts or generates request IDs for every HTTP request,
stores them in context variables for async-safe propagation across services, and
injects them back into response headers for client-side correlation.

This enables end-to-end tracing: HTTP → Middleware → Services → Plugins → Logs (all with same request_id)

    This middleware:
    1. Extracts request ID from X-Correlation-ID header in incoming requests
    2. Generates a new UUID if no correlation ID is present
    3. Stores the ID in context variables for the request lifecycle (used as request_id throughout system)
    4. Injects the request ID into X-Correlation-ID response header
    5. Cleans up context after request completion

    The request ID extracted/generated here becomes the unified request_id used in:
    - All log entries (request_id field)
    - GlobalContext.request_id (when plugins execute)
    - Service method calls for tracing
    - Database queries for request tracking

    Configuration is controlled via settings:
    - correlation_id_enabled: Enable/disable the middleware
    - correlation_id_header: Header name to use (default: X-Correlation-ID)
    - correlation_id_preserve: Whether to preserve incoming IDs (default: True)
    - correlation_id_response_header: Whether to add ID to responses (default: True)
