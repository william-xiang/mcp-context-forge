Database bootstrap/upgrade entry-point for MCP Gateway.
The script:

1. Creates a synchronous SQLAlchemy ``Engine`` from ``settings.database_url``.
2. Looks for an *alembic.ini* two levels up from this file to drive migrations.
3. Applies Alembic migrations (``alembic upgrade head``) to create or update the schema.
4. Runs post-upgrade normalization tasks and bootstraps admin/roles as configured.
5. Logs a **"Database ready"** message on success.

It is intended to be invoked via ``python3 -m mcpgateway.bootstrap_db`` or
directly with ``python3 mcpgateway/bootstrap_db.py``.

Examples:
    >>> from mcpgateway.bootstrap_db import logging_service, logger
    >>> logging_service is not None
    True
    >>> logger is not None
    True
    >>> hasattr(logger, 'info')
    True
    >>> from mcpgateway.bootstrap_db import Base
    >>> hasattr(Base, 'metadata')
    True
